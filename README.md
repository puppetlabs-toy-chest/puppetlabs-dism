##Overview
The dism module enables and disables Windows Features using the DISM utility provided by Microsoft

##Module Description

This module provides a `dism` puppet resource type on Windows. Windows Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM.exe)
 is used to enable or disable Windows features on Windows 7 SP1, Windows 8,  Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, Windows 2012 R2

##Setup

###What dism affects
`dism` will modify the existing features on the system, whether enabling or disabling. In some instances the server will
be restarted unless explicity setting the parameter `norestart` to `true`

###Setup Requirements
The module requires that dism be installed on your system, in most cases this will be there by default.  In some cases,
  such as Windows 7 it requires SP1 or to be manually installed.

##Usage
###To enable DotNet3 and all child settings
~~~ puppet
dism { 'NetFx3':
  ensure => present,
  all    => true,
  source => 'Z:\2012r2\sxs'
}
~~~

###To install IIS and provide an answer file for all setup steps
~~~ puppet
dism { 'IIS-WebServer':
  ensure => present,
  answer => 'C:\answer\iis.xml',
}
~~~

###To disable Internet Explorer and prevent restart
~~~ puppet
dism { 'Internet-Explorer-Optional-amd64':
  ensure    => absent,
  norestart => true,
}
~~~

##Reference
###Deployment on Azure Windows Server 2012 R2 Datacentre (Image from Azure Store)
####Windows Server 2012 R2 Datacentre does not have dism installed under c:\windows\sysnative 
####it is under c:\windows\system32
####to use it with no error, add the following file resource into your base code (before instantiating dism)
~~~ puppet
  file { 'C:/Windows/sysnative' :
    ensure  => directory,
  } ->
  file { 'C:/Windows/sysnative/dism.exe' :
    ensure             => present,
    source             => 'c:/windows/system32/dism.exe',
    source_permissions => ignore,
  }
~~~
